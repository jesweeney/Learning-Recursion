# Learning-Recursion
As I continue my computer science journey, I will need to understand recursion. This repository shows my basic programs, which demonstrate my learning. The objectives and goals of each file/program are listed in the following README.md file:

1. In the file SumIntegersRecursive.java, I completed the following request: Define a recursive function to sum integers from 1 to n.
public static int sumN(int n) {...}

2. In the file SumIntegers.java, I completed the following request: Define an iterative (non-recursive) function to sum integers from 1 to n.
public static int sumN(int n) {...}

3. Define a recursive function to compute the sum S(n)=1+2+...+n.

4. Compute the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two non-negative integers using Euclid'd algorithm:
gcd(x, y) = x if y = 0
gcd(x, y) = gcd(y, x % y) if y > 0

5. Write a program to convert a positive integer n into its binary representation. Use the method of repeatedly dividing by 2 into n and read the remainders backward.
